This letter will reach England by a \nmerchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archan -\ngel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, \nperhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my \nmen are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the \nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the \ndangers of the region towards which we are advancing, ap -\npear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high \nlatitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not \nso warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us \nspeedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to \nattain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had \nnot expected.\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make \na figure in a letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing \nof a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarce -\nly remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing \nworse happen to us during our voyage.\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own \nsake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.

Accordingly, a few months after \nyour departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by \nher repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quit -\nted our house; she was much altered since the death of my \naunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to \nher manners which had before been remarkable for vivac -\nity. Nor was her residence at her mother\u2019s house of a nature \nto restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating \nin her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive \nher unkindness but much oftener accused her of having \ncaused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fret -\nting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which \nat first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for \never. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the \nbeginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to us, and \nI assure you I love her tenderly.

In this expedition we did not intend to \nfollow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, \nOxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to \narrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. \nI packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I \nhad collected, resolving to finish my labours in some ob -\nscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained \na few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This \nwas a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the \nquantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all nov -\nelties to us.\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered \nthis city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the \nevents that had been transacted there more than a century \nand a half before. It was here that Charles I had collected \nhis forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the \nwhole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard \nof Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortu -\nnate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the \ninsolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar inter -\nest to every part of the city which they might be supposed \nto have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling \nhere, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.

The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a \nfew miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which \nconsisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs \ngave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, \nwhen they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, \nwas to be procured from the mainland, which was about \nfive miles distant.\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, \nand one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It \ncontained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squal -\nidness of the most miserable penury.
